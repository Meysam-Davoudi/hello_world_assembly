# Hello World with Assembly


> section	.text

This line declares the start of the .text section. The .text section typically contains executable code, such as instructions for the CPU to execute.
Instructions within the .text section are typically machine instructions that the CPU can directly execute.
All the executable instructions, including the program entry point (_start:) and the system calls (int 0x80), are placed within the .text section.

> global _start

This line declares the label _start as a global. _start is typically the entry point for the program and must be declared as global for the linker to find it.

> _start:

_start is a label that marks the entry point of the program. It's the starting point from where the CPU begins executing instructions when the program is run.

_start is the first instruction executed when the program starts running. It initializes the necessary registers, makes system calls to write the message to the standard output, and exits the program.

> mov	edx,len

This line moves the value of len into the edx register. len is the length of the message.

edx is used to store the length of the message string (len). This register typically holds the second argument for system calls, which often represents the length of data to be operated on or transferred.

Registers are small, fast storage locations within the CPU that are used to hold data temporarily during program execution. Each register typically holds a single piece of data, such as a memory address, a numeric value, or a status flag.

> mov	ecx,msg

ecx holds the memory address of the message string (msg). In system calls like sys_write, ecx typically contains the address of the buffer from which data is to be written.

> mov	ebx,1

This line moves the value 1 into the ebx register. In this context, 1 represents the file descriptor for standard output (stdout).

File descriptors are integer values that represent open files or other I/O resources. In Unix-like systems, 1 is the file descriptor for standard output (stdout), so the system call knows where to write the message.

Standard File Descriptors:

- 0: Standard input (stdin)
- 1: Standard output (stdout)
- 2: Standard error (stderr)

Special File Descriptor Values:

- -1: This is often used to represent an error condition or an invalid file descriptor.
- -2: Sometimes used for signaling special conditions, but not commonly seen in system call contexts involving ebx.

> mov	eax,4

This register is commonly used to store the system call number. In this code, eax is first set to 4, which is the system call number for sys_write (to write data to a file descriptor). Then, it is set to 1, which is the system call number for sys_exit (to terminate the program).

System call numbers used in Linux x86 assembly programming:

- sys_exit: 1
- sys_read: 3
- sys_write: 4
- sys_open: 5
- sys_close: 6
- sys_creat: 8
- sys_execve: 11
- sys_fork: 2
- sys_getpid: 20
- sys_kill: 37
- sys_brk: 45
- sys_mmap: 90
- sys_munmap: 91

> int	0x80

This is a hexadecimal representation of the number 128 in decimal. In Linux x86 assembly, 0x80 is commonly used as the interrupt number to invoke system calls. When the int instruction with 0x80 is executed, it triggers an interrupt, which transfers control from user space to kernel space, allowing the program to make a system call.

> mov	eax,1

This line moves the value 1 into the eax register. In Linux x86, 1 is the system call number for sys_exit, which is used to exit the program.

> section	.data

This line declares the start of the .data section. The .data section typically contains initialized data that the program uses during its execution.
Data declared in the .data section can include variables, constants, and strings.

> msg db 'Hello, world!', 0xa

msg: This is a label that represents the memory location where the string will be stored. It's a symbolic name that we can use to refer to this string in our code.

db: This directive stands for "define byte". It is used to allocate memory for the string and initialize it with the specified bytes.

'Hello, world!': This is the actual string that we want to store.

0xa: This is the ASCII code for the newline character (\n). 
[ASCII Table](https://www.asciitable.com)

So, this line defines a string stored in memory starting at the label msg, with the text "Hello, world!" followed by a newline character.

> len equ $ - msg

This line calculates the length of the message string msg by subtracting the current address ($) from the address of msg. While it's not strictly necessary for the program to function correctly, it's useful for ensuring that the correct length of the string is passed to the sys_write system call.
